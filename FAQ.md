# What the...?

Okay, so, first of all- This repo is a joke. It's all a joke. Don't take
anything here too seriously.

The issues and things linked to in this list are things *I* find funny. You
might not find them funny, and if that's the case, the onus is on you to
develop your obviously under-performing sense of humor.

**This is not intended to generate brigades!** Please don't be a jerk and
go to the linked issues, mailing lists, and projects and harass or malign
those people involved. Leave them alone.

# Hey, item X isn't a bug!

I'll admit I include things that aren't, exactly, bugs (such as patches
and similar things). It's all related, and I think it all fits thematically.

# Can you include bug XYZ in your list?

Maybe. Possibly. Feel free to submit a PR with any bugs you find funny. I
may or may not use it. If I do use it, I may add my own comments to it. If
I don't use it I may not give any reason why, so don't expect it.

The thing is, as I said in the description, this is an *opinionated* list.
So I'll tend to only include things *I* find funny.

But I'm not omniscient, I'm certain there are funny bugs and things out there
that should be included in this list but which I'm yet to encounter. So please,
submit PRs away.

# What should be included in this list?

It's semi-hazy, but, really, anything that *fits* could be included in this
list. This includes things like:

* Funny bugs/issues
* Funny patches
* Funny glitches
* Funny code

I guess the one big caveat is that everything has to be *real*. No joke bugs
(e.g., bug reports that exist solely as a joke, like [this](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35890)
or the myriad from Mozilla's issue tracker like [this](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95849) or
[this](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98491)) should *ever* be
included (mainly because they are too numerous, often of dubious humor, and are
"low-hanging fruit"). Real issues or code that is humorous are more rare and
far more valuable, IMHO.

# One of your links or descriptions are mean, you jerk!

I'll readily admit I'm not fit for polite company.

As I said above don't take the things I say here too seriously. Yes, I dislike
Javascript (and how it's taking over EVERYTHING... ARGH! NODE!) and yes, I
dislike PHP. But any things I say about them (or anything else) in this list
should be considered light hearted ribbing. Don't take any of it personally.

(In all honesty, some of the engineers I personally respect the most are
either Javascript developers *or* have been involved with PHP at some point
in their career.

# Where do I submit spelling or other similar mistakes?

File an issue, submit a PR, whatever. If I get to it, I get to it. If not,
*meh*....

# Why haven't you included XYZ in your list? It's awesome!

I'll admit I'm being selective about what to include here, and have, deliberately,
excluded many things. (Hey, it's *curated*, remember?)

I really want this list to be more for ones people may not have heard of before.
If something was or is high profile enough that *everyone* probably already
knows about it (e.g., the Y2K bug) then I probably wont be including it.
