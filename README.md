# Awesome Bugs

> An opinionated list of truly awesome bugs

I am easily amused. Since the dawn of time, circa
[4000 years ago](http://flyingspaghettimonster.wikia.com/wiki/Pastafarianism),
I've been collecting and bookmarking bugs which I find awesome. At some point,
it's not entirely clear when, I was inspired by
[@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s 
[awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), and the glut of awesome
lists, to collect these bugs in their own awesome list (because that's what
the world needs, more curated lists.) This is that.

## Table of Contwebs

Yeah, maybe once I find a way to organize this that makes sense...

* [xscreensaver: Fake crash screensaver should not be enabled by default](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=553529)

   [xscreensaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) is awesome, and jwz is a God.
   This collection of screensavers includes several that simulate various
   computer crash screens. They are the best screensavers, scientifically
   speaking, but that doesn't prevent people from being confused by them.
