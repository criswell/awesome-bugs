# Awesome Bugs

> An opinionated list of truly awesome bugs

I am easily amused. Since the dawn of time, circa
[4000 years ago](http://flyingspaghettimonster.wikia.com/wiki/Pastafarianism),
I've been collecting and bookmarking bugs which I find awesome. At some point,
it's not entirely clear when, I was inspired by
[@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s 
[awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), and the glut of awesome
lists, to collect these bugs in their own awesome list (because that's what
the world needs, more curated lists.) This is that.

## Table of Contwebs

Yeah, maybe once I find a way to organize this that makes sense...

## PEBKAC

* [xscreensaver: Fake crash screensaver should not be enabled by default](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=553529)

   [xscreensaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) is awesome, and jwz is a God.
   This collection of screensavers includes several that simulate various
   computer crash screens. They are the best screensavers, scientifically
   speaking, but that doesn't prevent people from being confused by them. It
   also has one of the best original author smackdowns in history.

* [number_format when passed a 0 as first function argument, returns null](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50696)

   PHP is a [delightful](http://phpsadness.com/sad/52) and [well-loved](https://www.google.com/search?q=php+sucks)
   language and, as shown by this bug, has both brilliant practitioners and careful
   developers who would never introduce API changing bugs.

* [Add internal state field to irq_desc](http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-tip-commits/msg11099.html)

   For when you really need people to stay off your lawn.

* [0xB16B00B5? Really?](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/13/154)

   If you're not getting it, then check the [punchline](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/13/209).

* [Re: RFC page-table walkers vs memory order](https://lwn.net/Articles/509149/)

   Leading underscores are also how I increase entropy on my single-character passwords.

* [apt-get moo doesn't look like a cow](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/56125)

   Answering the age-old question: How many engineers does it take to change an ASCII cow?

   Also answering the age-old question: How many years does it take to change an ASCII cow?

   Nine. the answer to the second question is apparently *nine*.

* [User-triggerable NULL pointer dereference due to utter plebbery](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-532)

   Jibbers McGee is the hero the internet needs.

* [Critical bug Skype 7.4.85.102: simple message crush client](https://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-archive/Critical-bug-Skype-7-4-85-102-simple-message-crush-client/td-p/3996419)

   http://: will undoubtedly grow up to marry Bobby Tables.

* [Outage Postmortem - July 20, 2016](http://stackstatus.net/post/147710624694/outage-postmortem-july-20-2016)

   All joking aside, this was a *fascinating* postmortem on a truly devious
   little bug. Amazing how the tiniest bits of regexp can bring a major
   website to its knees.

* [A glitch on Netflix caused some BBC nature show to get Aziz Ansari subtitles](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/4vv5f6/a_glitch_on_netflix_caused_some_bbc_nature_show/)

   And that goose was never seen again...
